# LinkRedirect
(Currently) Server-side link redirect tool for UNIX systems utilizing NGINX. Made in bash, and only requires one script to setup. This is my first real program!

<h1> Usage </h1>
To use LinkRedirect, first download/copy the file onto a UNIX system, running NGINX. Make sure you are in the same directory as the file before proceding. <br>
Then, use `bash linkredirect.sh` to start the program.
